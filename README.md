# Women-Diabetes-Prediction Using Data Science
## Project Overview
This research project focuses on prediction the likelihood of diabetes in women based on key health indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. Using data science techniques, our goal was to determine the relationships between these factors and the risk of developing diabetes.
## Dataset
We sourced our dataset from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive health data relevant to diabetes prediction. We modified and preprocessed the data using Python libraries to ensure quality and accuracy.
## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn
- Machine Learning: random forest, confusion matrix
## Project Partners
This project was a collaborative effort with the following team members:
- Maudene Rojas
- Yasmine Baker
- Desire Hernandez

We worked together to ensure a comprehensive approach to diabetes prediction using data science techniques.
