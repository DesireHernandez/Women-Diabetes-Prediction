# Women-Diabetes-Prediction Using Data Science
## Project Overview
This research project focuses on prediction the likelihood of diabetes in women based on key health indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. Using data science techniques, our goal was to determine the relationships between these factors and the risk of developing diabetes.
## Dataset
We sourced our dataset from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive health data relevant to diabetes prediction. We modified and preprocessed the data using Python libraries to ensure quality and accuracy.
## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn
- Machine Learning: random forest, confusion matrix
## Project Partners
This project was a collaborative effort with the following team members:
- Maudene Rojas
- Yasmine Baker
- Desire Hernandez

We worked together to ensure a comprehensive approach to diabetes prediction using data science techniques.
## Installation & Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
You donâ€™t need to install anything locally to run this project! All you need is a Google account to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), a cloud-based platform for running Python code.
### Dataset
1. Download the dataset:
The dataset used for this project is included in the repository. You can find it in the file folder.

Alternatively, you can download the dataset directly:

### Running the Project on Google Colab

1. Open the Colab notebook by clicking this link: [Women-Diabetes-Prediction on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zratgAur0y7IpBvVDdlz_Umsl2WSmRtl?usp=sharing).

2. Once the notebook is open, you'll need to upload the dataset to the Colab session:
   - Click the **'Files'** icon on the left sidebar.
   - At the top of the file pane, click the **'Upload'** button.
   - Select the dataset file you downloaded and upload it to the session.

3. After the dataset is uploaded, you're ready to run the code:
   - For each section, click the **Run** button (which looks like a play button) located under each title in the notebook.
   - Ensure you run the cells in order, starting from the top, to avoid errors.

4. The notebook will process the data, train the machine learning model, and output predictions based on the health indicators.
